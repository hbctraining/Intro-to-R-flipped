```{r}
#| label: load_data
#| echo: false
# Assign values
x <- 3
y <- 5
number <- x + y
```


# Exercise 1
To organize your working directory for a particular analysis, you should separate the original data (raw data) from intermediate datasets. For instance, you may want to create a `data/` directory within your working directory that stores the raw data, a `scripts/` directory for your R scripts, a `results/` directory for intermediate datasets and a `figures/` directory for the plots you will generate.

We have provided you with R project containing the `data/` directory and we made our `scripts/` directory together. For this exercise create the `results/` and `figures/` directories.

When finished, your working directory should look like this:

<img src="../img/Directories_made_annotated.png" width="400"/>

Click on the `New Folder` button of the "Files" tab. Type `results` and click "OK". Click on the `New Folder` button of the "Files" tab. Type `figures` and click "OK". 

# Exercise 2

Try highlighting only `3 +` from your script editor and running it. Find a way to bring back the command prompt `>` in the console.

Press the <kbd>ESC</kbd> button.

# Exercise 3

Try changing the value of the variable `x` to 5. What happens to `number`?

```{r}
#| label: change_x_value
# Show value of number
number
# Change the value of x to 5
x <- 5
# Show value of number
number
```

It doesn't change.

Now try changing the value of variable `y` to contain the value 10. What do you need to do, to update the variable `number`?

```{r}
#| label: update_number
# Show value of number
number
# Change the value of y to 10
y <- 10
# Update the value of number
number <- x + y
# Show value of number
number
```
