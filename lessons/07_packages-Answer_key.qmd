# Exercise 1

The `ggplot2` package is part of the [`tidyverse` suite of integrated packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) which was designed to work together to make common data science operations more user-friendly. **We will be using the `tidyverse` suite in later lessons, and so let's install it**. *NOTE: This suite of packages is only available in CRAN.*

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Install tidyverse
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
